If the condition is true, the **`break`** statement ends the loop.\n<br>The fifth line uses the **`break`** statement. Whenever the \"if\" the condition is true, the line will execute and end the loop. \n<br>The sixth line shows the variable **`A`** and the **`+=`** *assignment operator* adds a value of **6** to the current variable value. \n<br>**Note:** The \"while\" loop will run by incrementing the value of  **`A`** by **6** for each time, so long as the Conditional statement ( A < 36) is True. When this becomes False (A >=36), the \"while\" loop will not run.\n\n#### Source Code #8\n```Python\nA = 1\nwhile A < 36:\n  print(A)\n  if A > 20:\n    break\n  A += 6\n``` \n\n#### Output \n    1\n    7\n    13\n    19\n    25\n    \n## Task B: Write the code\n<br>Step 1: Using source code #8 as an example, write the first line of code to declare a variable called **`myval`** and assign the value: **45**\n<br>Step 2: Write the second line of code with while-loop syntax to include a comparator with less than sign to the value of 90.\n<br>Step 3: Write the third line of code to print the variable. Remember to indent this line of code to avoid an indentation error.  \n<br>Step 4: Write the fourth line to begin an \"if\" statement to test if **`myval`** is greater than 80.\n<br>Step 5: Write the fifth line to write the break statement. \n<br>Step 6: Write the sixth line to show the variable **`myval`** and increment it by **8** using the assignment operator  **`+=`** having value as **8**.\n<br>Step 7: Run your code to view the output.\n",
